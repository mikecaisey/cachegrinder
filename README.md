# cachegrinder - An Xdebug Cachegrind translator (WIP)

Cachegrind (a subset of Callgrind) has a context free grammar used to make declarative statements that describe time and memory costs of a procedure. In this repository the statements of time and memory complexity are captured using Xdebug and PHP as files are loaded and functions are executed by the interpretor.
