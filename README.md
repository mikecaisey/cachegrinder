# cachegrinder - An Xdebug Cachegrind translator (WIP)

Cachegrind (a subset of Callgrind) has a context free grammar used to make declarative statements that describe time and memory costs of a procedure. In this repository the statements of time and memory complexity are captured using Xdebug and PHP as files are loaded and functions are executed by the interpretor. In this discussion the execution tree is one of Wordpress.

// All nodes joke chart

// Filtered chart including HTTP start and persistence finish

// JSON style rule set, pushdown-automata and finite state machine

// parsed tree of the filtered view

// Chart of translation
// * cachegrind file
// * javascript functions
// * JSON nodes and edges

// Thoughts about what the size of nodes tell you in time and memory complexity.
// .. What the nodes with the most edges tells you.
